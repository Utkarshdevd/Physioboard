{"name":"Physioboard","tagline":"Physioboard demonstrates iOS/Python/Web prototypes for \"real-time\" physiological data acquisition and visualization (i.e., skin conductance, heart rate...etc).","body":"Real-time Skin Conductance Data Visualization (PhoneGap)\r\n============\r\nUpdate: This was an early prototype done in summer 2011 (very out-dated). I put together a solution using the Python Tornado Web Server (http://www.tornadoweb.org/) with its WebSocket to keep the \"real-time-ness\" of data. On the iOS client side, I use PhoneGap (http://www.phonegap.com/) + some WebSocket hacks to display real-time data. However, this project shows the basic functionality (well, at least, for the real-time data). It is still at the prototype stage. I hope this solution can shed some lights on streaming real-time physiological data to iPhone/iPad in order to encourage more usage scenarios of real-time physiological data. \r\n\r\n-- \r\nJackie Chia-Hsun Lee\r\njackylee@media.mit.edu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
